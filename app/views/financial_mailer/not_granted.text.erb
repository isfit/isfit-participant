Dear ISFiT Participant,

We regret to inform you that you have not been granted financial aid for ISFiT 2015. Due to limited funds we were only able to support a very small number of students, and have to reject the majority of the applications.

Please remember that all communication from now on will happen through your personal profile, so please do not answer directly to this e-mail.

We are sorry that we were not able to support you financially, but hope that you will still be able to come.

Best regards,
The Participant Team
ISFiT 2015
