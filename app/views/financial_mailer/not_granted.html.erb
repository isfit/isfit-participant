<p>Dear ISFiT Participant,</p>

<p>We regret to inform you that you have not been granted financial aid for ISFiT 2015. Due to limited funds we were only able to support a very small number of students, and have to reject the majority of the applications.</p>

<p>Please remember that all communication from now on will happen through your personal profile, so please do not answer directly to this e-mail.</p>

<p>We are sorry that we were not able to support you financially, but hope that you will still be able to come.</p>

<p>
  Regards,<br>
  The Participant Team<br>
  ISFiT 2015<br>
