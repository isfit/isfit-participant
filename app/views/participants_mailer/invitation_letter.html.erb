It is essential that you now start planning your visa application and trip to
Trondheim. <strong>Your visa application should be delivered at the Norwegian embassy

date, the embassy might not be able to evaluate your application in time for
the festival. However, you cannot apply for a visa before 7th of November.
Also, remember to fill your travel plans into the given form on your personal
profile by 15th of January. All the important dates will be put in a timeline
at the end of this e-mail.  Through your personal profile, we will do our best
to guide you through these processes.

  <p>
We regret to inform you that you have not been granted travel support
for ISFiT 2013. Due to limited funds we were only able to support a
very small number of students, and have to reject the majority of the
applications.
