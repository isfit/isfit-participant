<strong>Dear ISFiT participant</strong>
</p>
<p>
Congratulations! You have made it through all the deadlines, and you are
now guaranteed to attend ISFiT 2013. We are very proud to have you as one
of our participants.
We would now like to give you some important practical information
concerning your arrival.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arrival in Trondheim</strong>
</p>
<p>
We expect the participants who arrive in Trondheim to do so on the 7th of
February. The participant team will be at Værnes Airport in Trondheim to
welcome you, and hand out tickets to the shuttle bus going to the centre of
Trondheim. If your flight is delayed, and there is no one from the
participant team there to meet you, please contact the staff at the
airport, and they will help you to get to Trondheim.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arrival in Oslo</strong>
</p>
<p>
We expect the participants who arrive in Oslo to arrive on the 6th of
February. Representatives from ISFiT will be at the airport in Oslo to
welcome you.
If you arrive with train/bus/boat to the centre of Oslo, you have to take
the Airport Express Train from the central station to Oslo Airport
Gardemoen. This takes about 20 minutes, and will cost 85 NOK (approx. 15
USD) with a student ID card.
Those who have ordered ISFiT transportation will have to purchase the
tickets for 200 NOK *each way*. Please note that we will only accept NOK.
You can find cash machines and exchange services at the airport.
The bus departs at 10:00 PM, for those who are delayed we will also have a
bus departing later.
If you arrive on the 7th of February in Oslo, you will have to find
transportation to Trondheim yourself.

<strong>Arrival day</strong>

<strong>Registration</strong>
</p>
<p>
The participant registration (check in) will start on the arrival day 7th
of February, and it will take place in Studentersamfundet. We will start
the registration at 7AM. Entry through the main door.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who have not been able to register before 8 p.m. at
Studentersamfundet, you will be able to do this at the Trafo. The Trafo is
a red building situated between Studentersamfundet and Gløshaugen.  This is
where the information centre of the festival is located.
</p>
<p>
If you arrive in Trondheim before the 7th of February, ISFiT is not
responsible for your stay.
However, if you have not succeeded in finding a place to stay, the Trafo
will be open as an information central from the 6th of February.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hosts</strong>
</p>
<p>
All the participants will be put together with a host on the arrival day.
This will also take place in Studentersamfundet, the same place as the
arrival registration. Your host will provide accommodation for you during
the whole ISFiT festival, from the 7th to the 17th of February. After this
period your host will no longer be responsible for your stay.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is happening on the arrival day?</strong>
On the arrival day you will be registered, and then you will meet your
workshop leader and group. There will probably be some waiting from the
time you arrive until your host picks you up. This is a great opportunity
to get to know your workshop! Food will be served at approximately 8 a.m.
and 12.30 p.m. This is a day of logistical challenges and it is important
to follow the guidelines you will get from the functionaries when you
arrive at Studentersamfundet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Departure day</strong>
</p>
<p>
The departure day is on the 17th of February, and this is the last day
organized by ISFiT. It will be your final day in your workshop and the last
day your WOC (workshop contact) will register your attendance. After the
17th of February the ISFiT festival is officially over. The ISFiT
transportation from Trondheim to Oslo Airport Gardermoen departs at 8.30
p.m. from Studentersamfundet.

<strong>Guinness World of Records attempt at ISFiT</strong>
</p>
<p>
ISFiT will attempt a world record on the 11th of February on the ski day.
We intend to form a human chain containing the most nationalities of the
world.
In order to carry out this attempt we rely on you taking part.
We inform you of this already now so that you can decide whether or not you
wish to participate in our effort to create a world record.
</p>
<p>
Those who want to participate *must bring a copy of their passport *to the
Ski Day. The copy will be sent to the Guinness World of Records as
evidence. It is essential to bring this copy to be able to document the
variety of nationalities in the attempt.
