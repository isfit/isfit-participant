Dear <%= @participant.first_name %> <%= @participant.last_name %>,

Thank you for applying for ISFiT 2013!

We hereby wish to inform you that the first round of selecting participants to this yearâ€™s festival
is now over. Unfortunately, due to the large number of applications we cannot at this time offer
you a place. We would, however, like to offer you a waiting list position.

You have been assigned a personal profile at https://participant.isfit.org.
You can log into this with the following credentials:
Username: <%= @participant.user.email %>
Password: <%= @participant.user.first_password %>

Please change the password once you log in.

All contact with the ISFiT-team will happen through this profile. It is important that you log on as soon
as you can, to confirm that you want to be on the waiting list for ISFiT 2013. The deadline for confirming
the waiting list position is the 15th of November. If you do not confirm the position by this date, you will
lose your place.

The final results will be available on the 15th of January. If you are granted participation at ISFiT 2013,
the final deadline for confirming participation at the festival is the 20th of January.

Through your personal profile, we will do our best to support you until the festival. If you have any
queries, please do not hesitate to contact: question@isfit.org

Yours sincerely,

The Participant Team
