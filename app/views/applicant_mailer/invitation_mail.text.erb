Dear ISFiT applicant,

Congratulations, you have been selected to participate at ISFiT 2015!

For a closer look at your invitation and further information please log onto https://participant.isfit.org. Please follow the steps indicated at https://participant.isfit.org. This is the same website you used to apply for ISFiT. You can log in by using the same username and password as before. 

Some of you have not been invited to the workshops that you originally applied for because we did a careful evaluation of your application, and found that you are a better match for another workshop. 

If you have any questions regarding the festival, please contact us at https://participant.isfit.org. 

We are looking forward to see you in Trondheim in February 2015!

Yours Sincerely,
The Participant Team
