Dear sir or madam,

You are receiving this email because you are on the waiting list for ISFiT 2015. 

Unfortunately, we have enough participants for the festival and we are therefore not able to extend an invitation to you. 

We receive and extraordinary number of applications and are sadly not able to invite everyone, but we were very impressed by your application and we hope you will apply again for ISFiT in 2017. 

Sincerely,
ISFiT
