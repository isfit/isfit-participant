            <p class="style2">The title of ISFiT 2011 is "Globalize This: Health". Health is more than the absence of illness. Global health  all people and the way they interact with each other, their living conditions, and their life quality. ISFiT 2011 wants to put health back on the international agenda. ISFiT is a meeting place where future leaders are given a chance to be heard, establish networks and learn from each other.</p>

Food and accommodation in Trondheim is free of charge for the participants, and will be taken care of by ISFiT.</p>

Representing the city of Trondheim and its institutions for higher education, the ISFiT Foundation proudly welcomes you to Trondheim and ISFiT 2011.</p> 
            <p class="style2">We consider it most important that all those who are invited are able to attend ISFiT 2011. We therefore hope that universities, companies and embassies will do their best to help the selected participants.<br>
