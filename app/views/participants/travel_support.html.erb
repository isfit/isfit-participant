<p>Dear <%= @participant.last_name %>, <%= @participant.first_name %></p> 
<p>You have been granted travel support in the amount of: <%= @participant.travel_support %> USD</p> 
<p>
Please note that the travel expenses will be refunded during the festival in
February 2013. You will be asked to present your ticket stubs and travel
receipts, so please do not throw these away.

<p>
From your application and our conducted research, this sum should help
you cover what you need for a round trip ticket from your home country to
Trondheim, Norway. Please note that the travel support does not cover
passport or visa expenses.
</p>

<p>
We would like you to find tickets directly to VÃ¦rnes airport in Trondheim.
If you are only able to fly to Gardermoen airport in Oslo, bus and train
transportation to Trondheim will be arranged by ISFiT at the cost of NOK 200
(approx. 35 USD) one way. More information on travel options is available in
the information brochure you received by email and on your personal profile.
</p>

<p>
An invitation email has been sent to you where you have been given access
to your own personal profile at https://participant.isfit.org. In this profile there
is a schema regarding travel information. You need to show us proof that you
have started to plan your trip by 15th of December. If you fail to do this you risk
losing your travel support as it might be given to someone else.
</p>

<p>
Due to our limited funds, the majority of the travel support applications have
been rejected. For this reason we kindly ask you to be discrete towards other
participants about your advantageous situation.
</p>

<p>
We wish you good luck planning your trip and look forward to seeing you in
Trondheim in February 2013. If you have further questions, please contact us
through your profile at https://participant.isfit.org.
