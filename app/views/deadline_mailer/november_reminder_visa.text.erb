Dear participant,

This email is a reminder: You need to accept the invitation to ISFiT 2015 before the 14th of November.  You also need to confirm that you have been to an embassy and applied for a visa. If you fail to do so, you cannot participate in the festival. If you are not able to do this in time, please notify question@isfit.org as soon as you can.

Sincerly,
ISFiT
