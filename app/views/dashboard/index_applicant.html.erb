<h2>Dialogue application</h2>

<p>
  The Dialogue Groups is ISFiTs conflict resolution initiative. ISFiT introduced this type of seminar to create a place for participants from different sides of conflicts to meet on equal grounds for sharing of experiences. Instead of putting the participants on each side of negotiation table much of the learning happens through games and play. The games make grounds for reflection, to analyse and discuss the present situation in the conflict areas.  
</p>

<p>
  This year we welcome students from <strong>Rwanda, Burundi, and South Africa</strong> to apply for the Dialogue Groups.
