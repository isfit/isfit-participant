<h2>Financial aid application</h2>

<p>ISFiT 2015 aims to have skilled participants with diverse backgrounds regarding geography, culture, class and gender. To achieve this goal, we will be able to offer some participants financial support.</p>

<p>Please note that we have a limited sum to offer, so we encourage you to search for alternative ways of financing your participation. There are a variety of scholarships and legacies you could apply for, or your university may be able to support you.</p>
