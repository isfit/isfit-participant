TRANSPORTATION FROM THE AIRPORT OR TRAINSTATION IN TRONDHEIM

You have already informed us about your arrival at participant web. If this info is uncorrect or changed, please contact your contactperson.

ARRIVAL

To get from Værnes (Trondheim airport) to Studentersamfundet in Trondheim on the day of your arrival, you have to use the buses provided by Værnesekspressen (gray buses). These buses will also have the ISFiT logo near the front, so they should be easy to spot. Only these buses will accept your invitation to ISFiT as a valid ticket until you receive your festival bracelet. If you should need any help, volunteers from ISFiT will be present at the airport at the 5th of February – feel free to contact them, they are there for you! If you get there before the 5th, you will have to find the buses by yourself. From the 1st of February you can take this bus for free, if you have the invitation. 

If you arrive to Trondheim by train, there will be volunteers at the train station both the 4th and the 5th of February. Since you have not yet gotten your festival bracelet, the volunteers will give you a ticket for the bus to Studentersamfundet at the 5th of February. If you arrive by train before the 5th, you have to get to Studentersamfundet at your own expense. 

DURING THE FESTIVAL

All participants can use AtB's buses free up to and including the 15th of February. Participants must show their festival bracelet to the bus driver when entering the bus. Please note that this offer is not valid for AtB's night buses.

The night buses will be provided by ISFiT. The night buses will depart from the backside of Studentersamfundet at precisely 01:30 AM and 02:30 AM the following dates:

 * Friday 06.02.15
 * Saturday 07.02.15
 * Wednesday 11.02.15
 * Friday 13.02.15
 * Saturday 14.02.15

Please be by the buses fifteen minutes before departure, as the buses will not wait for you. If you miss the buses, you will have to take a taxi at your own expense – and Norwegian taxis can be quite expensive!

DEPARTURE

If you are departing from Trondheim Airport Værnes, you can take the buses provided by Værnesekspressen, the same buses you used to get to Trondheim. If you are leaving by train, you have to get to the train station at your own expense.
