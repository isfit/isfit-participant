Dear participant,

From now on, all communication with ISFiT will happen on participant.isfit.org with your contact person. If you have any questions, you can just click the “Question”-button on the top of the page when you are logged on to participant web. There your contact person will answer your questions. This means that you should not send e-mails to question@isfit.org when you have questions.

Sincerly,
ISFiT
